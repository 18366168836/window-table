```bash
yarn add window-table
```

## Basic Usage

Let's start with an example. 

To begin, we will need some data to be rendered by the table.
This data can be either an array of objects, or an array
of arrays. **For this example, we will use an array of objects.**

For the time being, let's define the data statically.
In a real world situation, this data would potentially 
come from an API.

```jsx harmony
const data = [
  {name: 'Naruto', age: 24, clan: 'Uzomaki'},
  {name: 'Hinata', age: 22, clan: 'Huga'},
  {name: 'Itachi', age: 28, clan: 'Uchiha'},
  //...and thousands or millions of data
];
```

Now we need to define the column metadata, which will
instruct the window-table on aspects such as the
width of each column, order of the columns, the column
headings etc.

```jsx harmony
const columns = [
  {key: 'name', width: 100, title: 'Name'},
  {key: 'age', width: 80, title: 'Age'},
  {key: 'clan', width: 150, title: 'Clan'}
];
```

Now we can render the table by supplying these two pieces
information as props. 

```jsx harmony
import { WindowTable } from 'window-table';

const data = [
  {name: 'Naruto', age: 24, clan: 'Uzomaki'},
  {name: 'Hinata', age: 22, clan: 'Huga'},
  {name: 'Itachi', age: 28, clan: 'Uchiha'},
  //...and thousands or millions of data
];

const columns = [
  {key: 'name', width: 100, title: 'Name'},
  {key: 'age', width: 80, title: 'Age'},
  {key: 'clan', width: 150, title: 'Clan'}
];

function ShinobiTable (props) {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      style={{height: '500px'}}
    />
  )
}
```

Note: We have used an inline style to define the 
height of the table. This can however be done by any other
means like CSS, Styled Components or even by passing the 
height as a prop to the table. 

If none is specified, the height will be bounded by
100% of the view port height.
