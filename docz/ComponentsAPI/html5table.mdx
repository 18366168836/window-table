# HTML5Table

The `HTML5Table` component has the exact same props as the
`WindowTable` component.

The main difference is that, here, we have overriden the wrapping components.

Let's look at some code to understand what that means...

```jsx harmony
const Html5TableExample = props => {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      className="table"
      Cell="td"
      HeaderCell="th"
      Header='thead'
      HeaderRow="tr"
      Row="tr"
      Body="tbody"
      Table="table"
      {...props}
    />
  );
};
```

In addition to that, the `Html5Table` component accepts an additional prop: `headerClassName`.
This is convenient for cases where the `thead` components need special class names.

eg:
```jsx harmony
<Html5Table
    data={data}
    columns={columns}
    className="table-sm table-striped"
    headerClassName="thead-dark"
/>
```

of course, this could have been done by overriding the `Header` by yourself.

```jsx harmony
<Html5Table
    data={data}
    columns={columns}
    className="table-sm table-striped"
    Header={function THead(props) {
      return <thead {...props} className="thead-dark" />
    }}
/>
```
