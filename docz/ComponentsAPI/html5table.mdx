# HTML5Table

The `HTML5Table` component has the exact same props as the
`WindowTable` component.

The only difference is that, here, we have overriden the wrapping components.

Here's the code from the library, to explain that:

```jsx harmony
const Html5Table = props => {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      className="table"
      Cell="td"
      HeaderCell="th"
      Header='thead'
      HeaderRow="tr"
      Row="tr"
      Body="tbody"
      Table="table"
      {...props}
    />
  );
};
```
