> Windowing Table for React based on React Window

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/window-table.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/window-table) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

This ReactJs table library is a tiny, yet powerful implementation of a windowed/virtualized table, based off the awesome
virtualization library, `react-window` by Brian Vaughn. 

* Blazing Fast - thanks to `react-window`
* Tiny footprint - <2kB
* Super easy to customize - Custom tags, class names and what not
* Supports HTML5 table tags
* Production Ready - Being used all over the Admin application at hipages, Australia

One big caveat of using a custom table is styling. For instance, a normal HTML based table can be easily
styled with a style system such as bootstrap, but a `div` based table requires a bit more effort.

Thus, in addition to the basic window table, we export an HTML 5 tags (i.e. `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc) based table, which is compatible with
popular style systems such as bootstrap. 

In fact, the HTML 5 tag based table is nothing but the basic windowed table with custom tags. You have full 
control over what these tags/components should be. 

## Install

```bash
npm install --save window-table
```

## Basic Usage

*See it live at* https://codesandbox.io/s/6w5ov594vn

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import {WindowTable} from 'window-table'

const data = [
  {name: 'Naruto', age: 24, clan: 'Uzomaki'},
  {name: 'Hinata', age: 22, clan: 'Huga'},
  {name: 'Itachi', age: 28, clan: 'Uchiha'},
  //...and thousands or millions of data
];

const columns = [
  {key: 'name', width: 100, title: 'Name'},
  {key: 'age', width: 80, title: 'Age'},
  {key: 'clan', width: 150, title: 'Clan'}
];

function ShinobiTable (props) {
  return (
    <div style={{height: '500px'}}>
      <WindowTable
        data={data}
        columns={columns}
      />
    </div>
  )
}
```
Note that we are wrapping the `WindowTable` with a `div` which has a height of `500px`.
Instead, we could have set that height in the `WindowTable` itself, 
or even in a parent container of `NinjaTable`.

We can also pass an explicit height. But this is discouraged unless
you know what you are doing.

## HTML 5 tags based table

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import {Html5Table} from 'window-table'

function Table (props) {
  return (
    <Html5Table
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      rowHeight={50}
    />
  )
}
```

## Using custom tags

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'

import {WindowTable} from 'window-table'

const CustomThead: React.ElementType = props => {
  return <thead {...props} className="thead-dark" />;
};

function Table (props) {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      rowHeight={50}
      
      className="table"
      Cell="td"
      HeaderCell="th"
      Header={CustomThead}
      HeaderRow="tr"
      Row="tr"
      Body="tbody"
      Table="table"
    />
  )
}
```

## Custom Cells by Column
Some cells in a table most likely needs to render something other than plain text.
In such cases, you can define the custom Component in the column options object.

```tsx
const CustomCell = props => {
  const {row, column} = props; // row comes from table data, column comes from column metadata
  
  function toggle() {
    // Do something based on data row, or column
  }
  
  // Render any react component
  return <Button onClick={toggle}>Click Me</Button>
}

const columns = [
  {key: 'col1', width: 100, title: 'Column A'},
  {key: 'col2', width: 120, title: 'Column B'},
  {key: 'col3', width: 150, title: 'Column C', Component: CustomCell},
];

function Table (props) {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      data={data}
      columns={columns}
      rowHeight={50}
    />
  )
}
```

Similarly you can pass a custom react component as `HeaderCell` to the column options
to render a custom header cell.

## Row Heights
The height of a row in the table is determined internally by rendering 
the first data row.
You can pass an index to `sampleRowIndex` prop to instruct the table
which data row to be used to measure the row height.

## Static table dimensions
The window table tries to measure both row dimensions and
table dimensions for you. 
However, you can opt-out of this behavior by supplying
explicit dimensions. 

The following example shows how table height, table width,
and rowHeight can be customized. The ones which are
not supplied will be measured. 

```tsx
function Table (props) {
  return (
    <WindowTable
      height={600}
      width={400}
      rowHeight={50}
    />
  )
}
```

This behaviour is not optimal if you want the table
dimensions to change based on CSS or window resize events.
